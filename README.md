Chapterized video
=====================
run this command in terminal from the root folder:

sass --watch sass/style.scss:./style.css

still to do:
- second version with other script option - jeff's way - work even if chapters 	not present

- fake controls : fullscreen(viewport) - still have controls and chapters
	showing; play/pause; volume(nice-to-have); scrubbar (nice-to-have)
	- fullscreen have video width 100% and height auto, fix position chapters and custom control bar on top, have show/hide on hover
	- think about chapter bar and how to control on full screen

- style

- fallback (very nice-to-have) -- disregard - would just be using swf object

- updated readme to explain reasoning as to why did what i did
